## Introduction

Welcome to the INTAL Project! INTAL stands for "Integer of Arbitrary Length," and it is an exciting venture that focuses on developing a library for handling arbitrary-length integers in C.<br><br>

The primary goal of the INTAL Project is to provide a powerful and efficient set of functions to perform various arithmetic operations on large integers, which may exceed the limits of standard data types like int or long in C. By handling integers of arbitrary length, the library empowers developers to work with extremely large numbers without any constraints.<br><br>

Our team of dedicated developers has put in significant effort to ensure that the INTAL library is robust, reliable, and user-friendly. We understand the importance of accuracy and performance when working with such vast numerical data, and thus, the library is optimized to deliver fast computations even for extensive integer values.<br><br>

Whether you are working on complex mathematical problems, cryptography, or any application that requires handling large numbers, the INTAL library will serve as a valuable tool in your programming arsenal.<br><br>

The INTAL Project is an open-source initiative, and we welcome contributions from developers worldwide. We encourage you to explore the library's features, contribute code, report issues, and collaborate with us to make INTAL even more powerful and versatile.<br><br>

Thank you for being a part of the INTAL Project. Let's push the boundaries of integer manipulation together and create remarkable solutions with this exceptional library!

## Installation

INTAL is a library for handling arbitrary-length integers in C programming language. To install INTAL on both Windows and macOS, you need to follow these general steps:

<ins>Download the INTAL library:</ins> You can find the source code or pre-compiled binaries of the INTAL library from my official GitHub repository.

<ins>Include the INTAL library in your project:</ins><br>
<b>For Windows:</b> If you have downloaded the pre-compiled binary, you need to include the header files and link against the library in your project. You can add the header files to your project's include path and link against the library during the build process.<br>
<b>For macOS:<b> You can include the header files and link against the library in the same way as on Windows.<br>
<ins>Build your project:</ins> After including the INTAL library in your project, build your project using your preferred C compiler.

## Usage

Usage of the INTAL library in a C program typically involves the following steps:

<b>Include the header file: In your C source code, include the INTAL library header file.</b><br>
```bash
  #include "intal.h"
```
<ins>Here are some common operations you can perform using the INTAL library:</ins><br>
<b>Addition:</b>
```bash
  const char* intal1 = "12345678901234567890";
  const char* intal2 = "98765432109876543210";
  char* sum = intal_add(intal1, intal2);
  // Use the 'sum' variable
  free(sum); // Remember to free the memory allocated by INTAL
```
<b>Comparision</b>
```bash
  const char* intal1 = "12345678901234567890";
  const char* intal2 = "98765432109876543210";
  int compare_result = intal_compare(intal1, intal2);
  // 'compare_result' will be -1, 0, or 1, representing less than, equal to, or greater than respectively.
```
